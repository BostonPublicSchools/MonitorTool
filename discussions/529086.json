This is the fifth using in the downloaded source file.  However this dependency is not in the online tutorial.<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen I tried to download the source everything built ok but my hello world dolls caused a top shelf exception.   I didn't make any changes to the dlls as I was trying to narrow down the problem.  Is it possible that I'm using different versions between the nuget, the downloaded source and the downloaded binaries?\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you!<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi - welcome to Wolfpack!<br />\n<br />\nFirst let me explain what versions exist and where...<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The latest source code in the repository (HEAD) is for v3.</li>\n<li>The current official release is v2.4</li>\n<li>All the &quot;release&quot; nuget packages are v2.4 compatible.</li>\n<li>\nThere is a &quot;pre-release&quot; set of v3 compatible packages and these only work against the v3 source code.<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nThe tutorial/first healthcheck targets v2.4. If you want the source code for v2.4 then you will need to get a specific version from the repository out. This is the version/changeset that v2.4 was released from: <a href=\"https://wolfpack.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/0187cc7cb839\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wolfpack.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/0187cc7cb839</a><br />\n<br />\nTo get this version of the source from HG, see this post (<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4148234/how-can-you-clone-a-mercurial-repository-as-of-a-specific-changeset\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4148234/how-can-you-clone-a-mercurial-repository-as-of-a-specific-changeset</a>) to help but you just need to clone with the version number 0187cc7cb839<br />\n<br />\nThere is also this thread with some advice/tips on debugging plugins...might be of use...<br />\n<a href=\"https://wolfpack.codeplex.com/discussions/493323\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wolfpack.codeplex.com/discussions/493323</a><br />\n<br />\nIf you stick with everything v2.4 then it should all work (and the tutorial be correct). Once I have v3 released I will update the docs to reflect the changes this version brings.<br />\n<br />\nCheers,<br />\nJames<br />\n",
