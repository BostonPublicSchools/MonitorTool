When I release v3 (should be this weekend) I'll include a source and binaries zip to download.\r<br />\n<br />\nIn the meantime if you can chocolatey install to a machine you can grab the install from where chocolatey puts it; default location is something like...C:\\Chocolatey\\lib\\Wolfpack.3.0.x\r<br />\n<br />\n...this folder is the equivalent of what will be in the binaries zip file. Grab the content of this folder and xcopy deploy to your non-chocolatey machines.\r<br />\n<br />\nHTH,\r<br />\nJames<br />\n",
