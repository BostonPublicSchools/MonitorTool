I tried to install Wolfpack using latest Chocolatey and it's failing -- time to see if I can fix that.\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever, CodePlex isn't that great for collaboration -- even MS teams moved most of their new projects to GitHub.\r<br />\n<br />\nI think it would awesome if this project was on GitHub, as it would make contributions much easier.<br />\n",
