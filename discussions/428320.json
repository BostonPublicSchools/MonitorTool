The documentation for the Geckoboard functionality is a bit stale and I apologise for this - a huge Wolfpack update is underway and a brand new Geckoboard feature will be included and this will have proper docs (and support Geckoboard push too).</p>\r\n<p>2. Linechart url formats are...</p>\r\n<p><span>http://</span><em>hostname</em><span>/geckoboard/<span>linechart/{check}/{outcome} - this provides a chart of the raw ResultCount value of the alerts for the matching check/outcome</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>http://<em>hostname</em>/geckoboard/linechart/{check}/{outcome}/{operation}/per/{rate} - this provides a numeric value (based on the alert ResultCount value)</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p>...where&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>{check} is the FriendlyName/Id of the check you want to display data for </li><li>{outcome} is the one of..&quot;Any&quot;, &quot;Failure&quot; or &quot;Success&quot;.

I'll upate the Linechart doc page with the above information and will try to refresh the other too. If you have any more specific troubles then drop me a message here and I should be able to fix you up ASAP.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>James</p>\r\n",

I will be looking forward for the wolfpack update as well.</p>\r\n<p>What i am trying to accomplish exactly is to create a line chart on the geckboard displaying a websites' response time.

    "Html": "\r\n<p>Hi, I have amended the answer I gave above - the description of the first example (<span>http://</span><em>hostname</em><span>/geckoboard/<span>linechart/{check}/{outcome}</span></span>) was wrong - it charts the ResultCount value, not the Count (ie number\r\n of instances).</p>\r\n<p>So...to answer your question - yes - the current release will be able to line graph your website response times. The url template above is the one you need to chart the response times - as you are logging the HealthCheck data to the database this will simply\r\n chart the response time that is stored in the ResultCount of each message. I would also put &quot;success&quot; in the outcome to ensure you only graph pings that worked.</p>\r\n<p>ie: http://<em>hostname</em>/geckoboard/linechart/<em>name of check reporting website response times</em>/success</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>James</p>\r\n",
