Please this thread in full to get you up and running...<br /><br /><a href=\"http://wolfpack.codeplex.com/workitem/5\" target=\"_blank\">http://wolfpack.codeplex.com/workitem/5</a><br /><br />I'm just about to release v2.3 - this has these problems fixed. If you&nbsp;download the latest source code (binaries not uploaded yet) &amp;&nbsp;compile/run from visual studio you should be able to run Wolfpack ok.<br />As mentioned on that thread I'd also install \"Growl\" - this is a&nbsp;system tray notifier and is probably the best way to \"see\" Wolfpack&nbsp;alerts (you can also forward alerts to your smart phone).<br /><br />Please drop me a message if you run into any more problems or need&nbsp;help configuring it to monitor your system. I'd also like to get any&nbsp;suggestions you have for new health checks or any idea in general to&nbsp;improve the system (apart from the obvious \"fix the config so it works&nbsp;first time\"!)<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />James</p>",
