As soon as I move it to 2 PCs then the publisher cant find the queue. All firewalls are disabled. For the output queue on the publisher do you need to specify more than just the queue name i.e.\r\n something like PCName\\private$\\WolfPackOutput ? or how does it know what PC the queue is on ?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n",
