Both have the same plugintype and configurationType. The only change is in the connection name.<br />\nSince when we try to register INotificationEventPublisher,IPluginType , it will throw the exception as the name already exists. Even if we mofify by having a named instance registration, it fails to pick up the right configuration information. \r<br />\nPlease advice. Thanks.<br />\n",

I made this change as part of the periscope dashboard plug-in as it requires multiple publishers of the same type to be active to push notifications to the dashboard so I'm pretty sure it works.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf you still have trouble can you post the json config file for each sql publisher you have set up?\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers,\r<br />\nJames<br />\n",
