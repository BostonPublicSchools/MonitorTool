    "Html": "Hi Bruno, thanks for the kind words, always nice to hear the software is appreciated!\r<br />\n<br />\nSo...the default install of Wolfpack does not come pre-configured to store notifications. Notifications are purely transient things (the exception is the Activity page, this has an ActivityTracker component that acts like an in-memory store of notifications...it keeps track of the last 20 notifications and that it what powers the Activity UI page).\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever (as you mention) it is possible to store these Notifications by configuring a special type of &quot;Publisher&quot;. There are currently two database publishers that Wolfpack supports as a &quot;Notification Repository&quot; (v3 now has a repository layer so that it can interact (read &amp; write) with stored Notifications).\r<br />\n<br />\nThe core install comes with a SQL publisher (based on Entity Framework) and there is a <a href=\"https://wolfpackcontrib.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Wolfpack.Contrib.Publishers.MongoDb\" rel=\"nofollow\">contrib publisher based on MongoDb</a>.\r<br />\n<br />\nTo enable the SQL publisher, go to the Configuration screen and the &quot;SqlServer&quot; tag should give you a &quot;SqlPublisher&quot; component. Click create and then save (the default settings should work fine). \r<br />\n<br />\nThe &quot;ConnectionName&quot; config property is &quot;Wolfpackv3&quot; - if you go to your install folder and look in the Config subfolder there is a &quot;data.connection.config&quot; file with a connection string for &quot;Wolfpackv3&quot; - you can modify this to point to a full SqlServer, by default it will create a localdb instance though. Modify the connection string as required then Accept the configuration change and it should now start storing notifications in the database.\r<br />\n<br />\nHTH!\r<br />\n<br />\nPS: I have created a stub &quot;<a href=\"https://wolfpack.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=v3HowToStoreNotifications\" rel=\"nofollow\">HowTo</a>&quot; article covering these instructions and will fill it out ASAP.<br />\n",
