Some checks allow multiple things to be monitored in a single check (eg: this disk space check could be modified to take a list of drive letters rather than a single drive letter. As it stands you need to define a new health check and binding for each drive you want monitored. It would be an easy mod to make the check take a list of drives...I can put that on the Issues list of you wish?</p>",
