    "Html": "<p>Yup the current implementation is for polling. Having had a quick look at the docs it shouldn't be difficult to build a push plugin at all, it's fairly trivial.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As I see it though the problem comes deciding what data should be pushed - you have all this alert data coming into Wolfpack,...how does it know what data and &nbsp;widget data type to push? Configuration obviously...so we need a way of selecting logic to query the data and build the correct json data.</p>\r\n<p>Which leads to the next question - the trigger for the push? As soon as an alert arrives I guess it should push the relevant data feed. I think that matching an alert to which data feeds it triggers is a significant problem but I'll put some thought into it this weekend. I am toying with the idea that the configuration is done in code as a drop in dll - it might be xml hell otherwise, still thinking...</p>\r\n<p>So - great idea and thanks for suggesting it - a lot of Wolfpack features start life as such.</p>\r\n<p>I'll post updates here and would welcome any discussion on the configuration side of things.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>James</p>",
