To do this you you need to supply the site with your UserAgent string\r\n as part of the header. I noted there was no way to set the UserAgent for the check URLPing. I also noted that it was not being set with any value.</p>\r\n<p>I update the code locally to have a default value as well as a way to set the value to what ever you may want. Simple really. I have been using it for a few sites&nbsp; I need to monitor. Works like a charm.</p>\r\n<p>I was going to post it as a patch but there is no option for that. Let me know how you would like the code submitted.</p>\r\n",
