Got it - looks good!\r<br />\n<br />\nInteresting to see you saving state to disk...I did have a feature to allow a check to support saving/restoring state but never took it past an interface - I think I might add this in for v3, provide simple state infrastructure so a check can just call Get/SaveState.\r<br />\n<br />\nIt'll take a few days to get it packaged - will let you know once ready to post to NuGet/go live - might need some details for the NuGet package metadata. \r<br />\n<br />\nI'll also port it to v3 and make sure it's automatically included in the latest version.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for the taking the time to help improve Wolfpack!\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\nJames<br />\n",
