Basically between current work and home commitments there isn't a great deal of time to devote to Wolfpack including the docs. I am planning to start work on it again this summer and have a blast through all the outstanding tasks including the docs but unfortunately not just yet.\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever...I think that you can probably work out how to build health checks, activities and publishers by taking apart a couple of the <a href=\"https://wolfpackcontrib.codeplex.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">contrib</a> plugins... the Growl publisher and Rabbit check would be a good place to start (source for all on contrib codeplex site). \r<br />\n<br />\nIf there are any specific questions or you hit a problem then let me know and I should be able to help you out.\r<br />\n<br />\nregards,\r<br />\nJames<br />\n",
