You can set as many times per day as you like and which days including shorthand configuration to set weekdays, weekends and every day of the week; these can all be combined to provide a complete custom schedule. Eg: you could configure a check to run on set times weekdays, set additional times for monday, wednesday &amp; saturday and have no timings on sunday.</li>
