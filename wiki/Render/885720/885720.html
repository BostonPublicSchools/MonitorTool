<div class="wikidoc"><h1>How To...Agent-to-Agent networking/messaging</h1>This article describes how to get one Wolfpack instance sending notification messages to another instance - eg: a distributed monitoring scenario.<br />
<h2>Quick Start</h2><ol><li>Install a Wolfpack instance on the &quot;client&quot; pc/server to be monitored (sender). (tip: chocolately install with &quot;cinst wolfpack&quot;). This instance will generate notifications.</li>
<li>Install a Wolfpack instance on the &quot;server&quot; pc/server (receiver).</li>
<li>Start both instances</li>
<li>On the &quot;client&quot; instance go to the configuration UI page (http://localhost:802/ui/configure) and locate the &quot;WebServicePublisher&quot; plugin (under WebService tag) and click &quot;Create&quot;.
<ol><li>Update the BaseUrl property to the ipaddress/machine name of the server/receiver instance (remember to use double quotes around the value)</li>
<li>Set ApiKey to blank (security is explained later)</li>
<li>Change FriendlyId to something like descriptive like &quot;BuildServerWolfpackPublisher&quot;</li>
<li>Enabled should be true</li></ol></li>
<li>Restart the client instance to pick up the configuration change</li>
<li>The server/receiver instance is enabled by default to receive messages via the <a href="https://wolfpack.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Wolfpackv3ApiNotificationNotify&referringTitle=v3HowToInterAgentMessaging">Notify Api method</a>
<ol><li>The default filesystem notification repository will be in operation - notifications will be stored as json format files in the <i>wolfpack install folder</i>\_notifications folder. 
<ol><li>You can change the default repository by configuring the Sql or MongoDb publisher (plus any other publisher that acts as a NotificationRepository).</li></ol></li></ol></li>
<li>Any notification generated on the client should now be sent to the server instance and rebroadcast to all enabled publishers.</li>
<li>Add more client instances as required.</li></ol>

As the connection is http based it can also be secured at the transport layer with SSL and logically with an API Key unique to each client.<br />
<ol><li>As a notification is generated on the client it is stored in the default notification repository (filesystem/json files). A background process executes every 10 seconds (configurable) to grab these queued notifications and attempt to send them to the receiving instance, this logic is wrapped up in a &quot;strategy&quot; component. If the notification cannot be sent it remains queued and will be resent in the next pass.</li>
<li>The actual mechanism to send the message is a simple POST api call</li>
<li>The &quot;strategy&quot; at the server/receiver instance will validate the notification to ensure it is not stale (too old) or a duplicate - if valid it will republish the notification to the internal message bus just as if it was generated locally.</li></ol>
