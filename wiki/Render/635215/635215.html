<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Health Checks</h1><div style="clear:both;height:0;">&nbsp;</div><img style="float:left;padding-right:.5em;" src="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=wolfpack&DownloadId=242345" alt="monitor.png" title="monitor.png" /><br /><br />This page contains all the information you need to know about the Health Checks including detailed information on each one supplied with Wolfpack. In general a HealthCheck will return a result that is &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; indicating success or failure of the test plus it will also provide a numeric (double) value in the ResultCount property - this value being appropriate to the specific test; eg: the MSMQ Queue Info HealthCheck Result property is based on whether the queue exists or not and the ResultCount value will be the number of items within the queue if it does exist. Please consult the documentation for each HealthCheck below for details on the value placed in the ResultCount property - this can help you should you wish to display this in a Geckoboard dashboard widget.<br /><br />A HealthCheck contains these data properties and each check will set them as required...
<ul><li>Result (bool)</li>
<li>ResultCount (double)</li>
<li>Tags (string) - comma delimited set of keywords to help identify this result</li>
<li>Properties (name/value string pair collection) - allows you to bundle ANY additional result information with this result.</li></ul>

<h3>Exception Handling</h3>A Health Check is effectively &quot;sandboxed&quot; by it&#39;s scheduler - very simply a Health Checks &quot;Execute()&quot; method is wrapped by the framework in a try/catch block and should it throw an exception it will be caught and details of the exception will be published; the result will be &quot;null&quot; as we don&#39;t know whether it actually passed or failed. Detailed information about the exception is available in the Result.Check.CriticalFailureDetails property; the Result.Check.CriticalFailure property will also be set to true to clearly indicate a critical failure has occured. The result message will also contain a GUID - this GUID is used by Wolfpack when it logs the error in the Wolfpack.log file and allows you to correlate the failing Result message with the exception details and stack trace in the error log.<br /><br />The Health Check will continue to execute in case this is just a transient problem. <br /><br />So - no explicit code is required to deal with exceptions, the Wolfpack infrastructure takes care of this for you however if you do need to trap an exception but still want this reported/handled by Wolfpack then in your custom HealthCheck provide your own try/catch and then just <b>rethrow</b> the exception after you have done your processing to allow Wolfpack to deal with it.<br />
<h3>Current Catalogue</h3>This is the current set of health checks provided by Wolfpack and provides comprehensive coverage for monitoring your system and applications however if you have a monitoring requirement not covered or would like to add a new feature to an existing check then please start a new <a href="https://wolfpack.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=discussions&referringTitle=Health%20Checks">discussion</a>. Finally it&#39;s easy to write your own check component and this <a href="https://wolfpack.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Walkthru%20Creating%20A%20HealthCheck&referringTitle=Health%20Checks">guide</a> provides a walk-thru to create a simple &quot;hello world&quot; check from which you can use as a base to extend.<br />
