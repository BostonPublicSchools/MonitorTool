<h2>Background</h2>It&#39;s great that Wolfpack can monitor stuff and count things like the length of a queue - what if you wanted to visualise this information though?...maybe have some sort of dashboard where all this information could be displayed?<br /><br />This is not a new problem for Wolfpack and it has had support as a data source for the fantastic <a href="http://www.geckoboard.com/">&quot;dashboard as a service&quot; Geckoboard</a> for a while now.<br /><br />I had previously resisted having to create my own &quot;dashboard&quot; for Wolfpack - considering slick solutions like Geckobard, <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/">Kibana</a> and <a href="https://wolfpack.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=https%3a%2f%2fdashku.com&referringTitle=Periscope">url&#64;dashku</a> exist already what would be the point? However once a development itch starts it&#39;s hard to resist scratching it...so I created a little &quot;proof of concept&quot; app and from there grew Periscope. <br /><br />Note: Wolfpack will continue to support Geckoboard and will also soon acquire the ability to push data into Dashku and Kibana.<br />
<h2>Project Periscope</h2><a href="https://periscope.codeplex.com/">Periscope is a .Net open source dashboard</a> app/framework. It allows you to define a dashboard via a fluent interface and provides the support for multiple rotating &quot;panels&quot; (screens) and flexible widget implementation - on a panel you can mix your custom html/script widgets with other frameworks such as HighCharts etc. It also supports a web api that allows you to push information to it in realtime (..ahem, from something like Wolfpack!) or anything else that can create a http post request and finally it is powered by SignalR so that realtime means realtime - as the event occurs it is pushed directly to all connected clients.<br />
<h2>Push Notification Support</h2>Wolfpack has a contrib plugin called &quot;DashboardAdapter&quot; (not released yet, sourcecode only in repo) that allows you to push notifications to dashboards you have running - the notification is formatted to the correct push message format and then sent to the dashboard api endpoint. <br /><br />DashboardAdapter allows you to define multiple dashboard endpoints and formats to receive push messages in response to a single Wolfpack notification - this is a pretty powerful feature as it allows you to visualise the same notification across different widget types and even different dashboards! For instance a url ping check could be a line graph in a Periscope dashboard AND a simple value display in Dashku!<br /><br /></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
