<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Roadmap</h1>This effectively provides a backlog of ideas for development. If you use Wolfpack and fancy getting your hands dirty developing on it then drop me a line via the <a href="http://Wolfpack.codeplex.com/team/view">People</a> page or the contact details on the main <a href="http://Wolfpack.codeplex.com/documentation">Documentation</a> page.<br /><br />There is also a contrib project running at: <a href="http://wolfpackcontrib.codeplex.com">http://wolfpackcontrib.codeplex.com</a><br />
<h2>New Idea?</h2>Add an item to the Discussion tab. Proposals that make the grade will be promoted to &quot;Incubating&quot; where we can shape and finalise the feature and then it can be added to the Backlog below.<br />
<h2>Currently in Development</h2>This is now maintained as a <a href="https://trello.com/b/8gto1kYr">public Trello board</a>.<br />
<h2>Backlog</h2><ul><li>Escalation plugin - monitor for alerts and escalate to Level2 if they are not resolved within a specific time.</li>
<li>Additional publishers...
<ul><li>Twitter (Direct Message)</li>
<li>Campfire</li>
<li>RavenDB</li>
<li>Oracle</li>
<li>SQL Compact</li></ul></li>
<li>Create a &quot;heartbeat&quot; message from each Wolfpack instance - I think this could solve the &quot;no news is good news?&quot; problem that a non-running Wolfpack poses. Essentially an Activity that just pumps an &quot;<i>I&#39;m alive</i>&quot; message out.</li></ul></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
