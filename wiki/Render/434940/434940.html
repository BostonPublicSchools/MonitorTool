<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Windows Service Startup </h1>This check will compare the startup type of a windows service to the type you expect the service to have. Often after system maintenance or service redeployment the startup type can be reset so this check will ensure your services are always in the correct startup mode. 
<h2>Features</h2><ul><li>Local and Remote - check for services on the same server as Wolfpack or a remote server.</li>
<li>Multiple services - create a list of services that should be in the same state, this cuts down on configuration.</li></ul>
<h2>Pre-requisites</h2><ul><li>Permissions to query/use the Service Control Manager information on the target server</li></ul>
<h2>Configuration</h2><ul><li>Set the &quot;ExpectedStartupType&quot; property; valid values are &quot;Auto&quot;, &quot;Manual&quot; &amp; &quot;Disabled&quot;</li>
<li>Set the &quot;Server&quot; property if you need to check services on machine different to the one running the Wolfpack Agent. Leave blank or remove the element to check against the localhost.</li>
<li>Add a new &lt;item&gt; to the &quot;Services&quot; property for each windows service you wish to monitor. You can use the service display or short name here.</li></ul>
