<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Activities</h1>
This page contains all the information you need to know about Activities including detailed information on each one supplied with Wolfpack. An Activity is essentially a background task - its starts with Wolfpack and runs until Wolfpack exits - and it can do anything it likes. HealthChecks are built on Activities - they just add on some scheduling and plumbing code to run the &quot;check&quot; at the right time. Activities are suited to providing infrastructure services to Wolfpack and are generally used to host communication connectors such as WCF ServiceHosts or the NServiceBus Bus.<br />
