<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Notifications</h1>Wolfpack notifications have been streamlined - there is a single notification message type now and all notifications are routed through the Notification Hub.<br />
<h2>Notification Hub</h2>The hub provides a single place for notification filtering logic to be applied. Notifications are now generated by the Health Checks as &quot;Notification Requests&quot; and are sent to the Hub to be matched with their requested filter - once the filter has been located it applies its logic and determines whether the notification should actually be forwarded onwards to the &quot;Publishers&quot; (as a fully fledged &quot;Notification&quot;; additional environment based information is injected into the &quot;Notification Request&quot;). You can write new filters and drop them in - just configure your HealthCheck plugin to use it via the &quot;NotificationMode&quot; property on your check&#39;s configuration.<br /><br />Wolfpack ships with a few built-in filters - these should cover most scenarios...
<ul><li>Always publish</li>
<li>Publish on failure</li>
<li>Publish on success</li>
<li>ResultCount Change - tracks the &quot;result count&quot; property of a check and only publishes if it has changed from the last notification received.</li>
<li>State Change - tracks the state of a plug-ins notifications and only publishes the notification request if it has &quot;flipped&quot; state from the previous notification. So if a check ran every 10 seconds and went into failure mode for 5 minutes you would get just one failure notification...followed 5 minutes later by a success notification.</li>
<li>State Change Nag - same as above but if the notification remains in the failed state it will continue to publish them but at an ever decreasing frequency.</li></ul>
