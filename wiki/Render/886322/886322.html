<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Storing Notifications in a database</h1>
The default install of Wolfpack does not come pre-configured to store notifications. Notifications are purely transient things (the exception is the Activity page, this has an ActivityTracker component that acts like an in-memory store of notifications...it keeps track of the last 20 notifications and that it what powers the Activity UI page). <br /><br />However it is possible to store these Notifications by configuring a special type of &quot;Publisher&quot;. There are currently two database publishers that Wolfpack supports as a &quot;Notification Repository&quot; (v3 now has a repository layer so that it can formally interact (read &amp; write) with stored Notifications). <br /><br />The core install comes with a SQL publisher (based on Entity Framework) and there is a <a href="https://wolfpackcontrib.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Wolfpack.Contrib.Publishers.MongoDb">contrib publisher based on MongoDb</a>. <br /><br />To enable the SQL publisher, go to the Configuration screen and the &quot;SqlServer&quot; tag should give you a &quot;SqlPublisher&quot; component. Click create and then save (the default settings should work fine). <br /><br />The &quot;ConnectionName&quot; config property is &quot;Wolfpackv3&quot; - in the Wolfpack install folder under the Config subfolder there is a &quot;data.connection.config&quot; file with a connection string for &quot;Wolfpackv3&quot; - you can modify this to point to any SqlServer instance. By default it will create a localdb instance. Modify the connection string as required then Accept the configuration change and it should now start storing notifications in the database once Wolfpack restarts. <br /><br /><br /></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
