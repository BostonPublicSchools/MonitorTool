    "Description": "After I create a certain test, fill in the config and save, the agent asks for a restart. I accept the restart but the interface doesn't get updated (activity tab remains the same, number of running plugins remains the same). If I manually close the agent and re-open it, then it gets updated. This happens for CPU test, DiskSpace, HostPing, Notepad-Running. Same thing happens when I try to delete a test: it doesn't disappear until I manually close and re-open the agent.",

Should work ok if running as a service. \n\nI'm also working on the config page at the moment and will fix this very soon. \n\nJ",
