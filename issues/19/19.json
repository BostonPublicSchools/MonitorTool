Email is compiled against RazorEngine 3.2.0.0, `Wolfpack.Agent.exe /update` installed RazorEngine 3.4.0.0. Strong naming FTW!\n\nIs this because `Wolfpack.Agent.exe /update` updates each package separately and does not honor transitive dependency requirements?",

I'll take a look at the code that manages the dependencies - interesting it is taking the latest and not the pinned version in the nuspec though.\n\nI will deploy the email package with dependencies embedded to fix it now (this evening UK) and look at the dependency resolution later.",
