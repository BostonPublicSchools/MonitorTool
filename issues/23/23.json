    "Description": "I configured a WindowsServiceStateCheck on the local agent to test if Wolfpack Agent is Running on a server. If I run the local agent as a console app, everything works fine. If I install it as a service, I get the following error:\r\n```\r\n2014-07-16 15:56:52,043 [11] ERROR Wolfpack [(null)] - Wolfpack Component Failure.
