    "Description": "When you configure a WCF forwarding infrastructure Publisher sending messages to a WCF Service Host - and then stop WCF Service Host - the publishing agent crashes - should it not log a unavailable endpoint and then retry - this could or would be common when forwarding across a WAN.  It appears as if the Bus forwarding option may allow for this behavior.  The logic for using WCF over the Bus was based on port requriements.\r\nMore testing shows that the same behavior occurs if the Service Host is not present when the publisher starts - ",
