In Gmail (web) the emails always show up as text, whereas Android displays the HTML (don't know about other clients).\r\n\r\nI've been [generating mail myself](https://gist.github.com/agross/a5492983eaa3b4f219a8), shouldn't be an issue: \r\n\r\nYou use Castle, why not use its generic email sender?\r\n",
