      "Message": "Thanks... that got me a little further. It seems that the GeckoboardDataServiceActivityConfig is also enabled and should not be. I disabled that by setting enabled to false in the activity.castle.config and it seem to stay running now.  I will be honest, I don't see it doing a lot of anything I would expect. I had notepad open when it started and then closed it. After 5 min I still see no change in the console output message. \n\nI was hoping for something that would let me know it actually works.\n\nTopshelf] After starting services complete\n2011-08-17 11:10:32,835 [1] INFO  Topshelf.Hosts.ConsoleRunHost [(null)] - [Topshelf] Running, press Control+C to exit.\n2011-08-17 11:11:31,891 [7] DEBUG Wolfpack [(null)] - Querying wmi namespace \\\\localhost\\root\\cimv2...\n2011-08-17 11:12:31,864 [7] DEBUG Wolfpack [(null)] - Querying wmi namespace \\\\localhost\\root\\cimv2...\n2011-08-17 11:13:31,832 [7] DEBUG Wolfpack [(null)] - Querying wmi namespace \\\\localhost\\root\\cimv2...\n2011-08-17 11:14:31,815 [7] DEBUG Wolfpack [(null)] - Querying wmi namespace \\\\localhost\\root\\cimv2...\n2011-08-17 11:15:31,836 [7] DEBUG Wolfpack [(null)] - Querying wmi namespace \\\\localhost\\root\\cimv2...\n2011-08-17 11:16:36,054 [7] DEBUG Wolfpack [(null)] - Querying wmi namespace \\\\localhost\\root\\cimv2...\n2011-08-17 11:17:35,285 [7] DEBUG Wolfpack [(null)] - Querying wmi namespace \\\\localhost\\root\\cimv2...\n",

      "Message": "Ok, great - I'll fix the Geckoboard Data Service enabled state in the next drop too.\n\nIn terms of your experience - I totally agree it is a little disappointing \"out-of-the-box\". The best way to receive alerts is with Growl (http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/about.aspx) but agree that as it ships it could do better than the DEBUG output you see. There is a contrib project that has a console publisher. \n\nThe next release of Wolfpack includes Sidewinder (sidewinder.codeplex.com - my new app updater based on NuGet) - with this I can bundle the console publisher contrib package with Wolfpack - this will provide a better OOTB experience.\n\nThanks for the feedback - keep it coming!\n\nJames",
